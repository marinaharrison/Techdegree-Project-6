        .about-bio

          p Hi, my name is Marina. I graduated from San Jose State University in 2020 with a degree in Marketing. Wanting to pursue my passion for technology, I became a Data Analytics apprentice after my graduation and unlocked a whole new world of tech development. I became passionate about building software and web applications that help people, and hopefully one day change the world. I am currently a FullStack TechDegree student at Treehouse and a Software Engineer Apprentice at Intuit. Oh, also did I mention that I'm awesome? I'm super awesome.
